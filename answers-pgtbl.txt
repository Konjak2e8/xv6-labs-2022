In addition to the getpid() system call, there are other xv6 system calls that could potentially be made faster using the shared read-only page optimization. One such system call is getppid(), which retrieves the parent process ID (PID) of the current process.
Here's how the shared page optimization can speed up the getppid() system call:
1. Map a read-only page at the same virtual address (USYSCALL) during process creation, just like in the getpid() optimization. Store a struct usyscall in this page and initialize it to store the PID of the parent process.
2. When a process calls getppid(), instead of crossing into the kernel space and performing a system call, the userspace function getppid() will directly read the PID of the parent process from the shared read-only page using the USYSCALL mapping. This avoids the overhead of a full system call and kernel crossing, making the getppid() operation faster.
By using the shared read-only page technique for the getppid() system call, the overhead associated with crossing the user-kernel boundary is eliminated. As a result, the system call execution time is reduced, leading to a performance improvement in scenarios where getppid() is frequently invoked.
